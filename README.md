# HTML5-Semantics-And-WAI-ARAI
This project implements HTML5 semantic tags and WAI-ARAI best practices.
I will be adding markup to the html files in this project.
I will be using HTML5 tags and WAI-ARAI best practices.
The emphasis will be on using the right semantic tags, and also using WAI-ARAI roles to make
the pages very accessible.
Accessibility is given great attention in the project.
